## Example overview 🌐 

The project is a simulation tool developed using ROS (Robot Operating System) nodes and leverages the Aerosandbox Python library for aerodynamic calculations. Its primary objective is to simulate gliding flight scenarios for a Cessna 152 aircraft in the event of engine failure.

The user provides flight parameters as input parameters to configure the simulation. These parameters are essential for defining the initial conditions of the simulated flight.

Once the simulation is initiated, the ROS nodes orchestrate the execution. The simulation takes into account various flight dynamics and aerodynamic factors to model the gliding behavior of the Cessna 152. The maximum gliding distance depends on plane's aerodynamic parameters, initial altitude and initial velocity. To find it this code uses iPOPT optimal problem solver under the hood (IPOPT included into AeroSandbox).

The output of the simulation comprises critical flight data, such as altitude, velocity, and other relevant parameters, recorded over time intervals. These results are published via ROS topics, allowing for real-time data visualization, analysis, and integration with other ROS-based systems.

You can find more information about this useful aerodynamics library on [Aerosandbox official website](https://github.com/peterdsharpe/AeroSandbox) [Poliastro Website](https://docs.poliastro.space/en/stable/).

## Code overview
This example consists of several files:
1. ```aerosandbox_cessna.py```. This the main project's file with a ROS 2 node defined. The ROS 2 node is used to orchestrate flight simulations of a Cessna aircraft and publishes the results via ROS topics. Users provide input parameters such as initial altitude (```h_0```) and initial velocity (```v_0```), crucial for defining the starting conditions of the simulation. The code invokes a simulation function (*_util_aerosandbox_cessna.run_*) with the specified parameters to perform the Cessna aircraft flight dynamics simulation. A timer is set up to periodically publish the aircraft's state data, including its position, altitude, and velocity. These state updates are logged and published on the ROS topic */aerosandbox_cessna/state*. Upon completing the simulation, the ROS 2 runtime is shut down.

2. ```util_aerosandbox_cessna.py```. This Python code is a optimization tool for modeling the flight dynamics of an aircraft. The code utilizes the Aerosandbox library and initializes a simulation to study the behavior of a Cessna 152 (this aircraft type is used for simplicity) aircraft in flight. The simulation is constructed using optimization techniques, and it defines a time horizon with an initial guess for the simulation duration. The dynamics of the aircraft, including its position, altitude, speed, and angle of attack, are modeled using differential equations. Aerodynamic forces and gravitational effects are incorporated into the simulation to simulate real-world conditions. The optimization problem aims to maximize the downrange distance traveled by the aircraft. You can find all the mathematical explanation in the [AeroSandbox example page](https://github.com/peterdsharpe/AeroSandbox/blob/fb7e481b0dd251638e07c4379057b530b83367ea/tutorial/03%20-%20Trajectory%20Optimization%20and%20Optimal%20Control/03%20-%20The%20AeroSandbox%20Dynamics%20Stack/04%20-%202D%20Aircraft%20Dynamics%20for%20Mission%20Performance%20Analysis.ipynb). 
Upon solving the optimization problem, the simulation results are logged, and the code returns the aircraft's position, altitude, and speed data to the main ROS node. 
 
3. ```cessna152.py```. The plane's aerodynamic functions defined here: 
    The code defines two airfoil profiles, "naca2412" and "naca0012," and generates their aerodynamic polars. These profiles are used to define the wing sections of the aircraft.
    An "Airplane" object consists of several components, including wings, horizontal stabilizers, vertical stabilizers, and a fuselage. The wings are defined with multiple wing cross-sections ("WingXSec") that specify the airfoil shape, chord length, and other wing parameters. The wing geometry is defined symmetrically. The horizontal stabilizer and vertical stabilizer components are also defined with their respective cross-sections and geometry. The fuselage is defined with a series of cross-sections that describe its shape and dimensions. 
    The code then draws a three-view representation of the Cessna 152 using the defined geometry.

The project also cantains several additional files for aerodynamic calculations under the ```resource``` folder: ```naca0012.json``` and ```naca2412.json```. They store aerodynamical profiles used for wings and other aerofoil planes for the Cessna 152. They are included into ```cessna152.py``` file.

### Configuring the project ⚙️
After all the prerequisites done, we can start configuring our project. The starting point is the Lunar_Starship devcontainer loaded and running, CITROS CLI is installed and ready.
1. Initialize CITROS:
```bash 
citros init
```
Now you can see ```.citros``` folder in the explorer.

2. Configuring the setup. We need to set up the maximum perfomance available: timeout, CPU, GPU and Memory. To perform it, we need to define it in the ```.citros/simulations/simulation_aerosandbox_cessna.json```. The recommended setup is minimum 180 seconds timeout, 2 CPU, 2 GPU and 1024 MB of Memory. Don't forget to save the file!

3. Configuring the params setup. You can find default setup in ```.citros/parameter_setups/default_param_setup.json```. The Aerosanbox simulation has the following ROS parameters:

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Parameter} & \text{Description} \\
\hline
h\_0 & \text{Initial alitude (m)} \\
v\_0 & \text{Initial velocity (knots)} \\
publish~freq & \text{frequency of publishing} \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$


Don't forget to save the file!
