## Example Overview üåê 

![jpg](img/starship.jpg "FoxGlove example")

This Lunar Starship mission project addresses the lunar hopper challenge by optimizing the ascent, ballistic flight and landing process on the Moon's surface, aiming to minimize fuel consumption, time, or other relevant parameters. It empowers users to define both theoretical and real dynamic functions, enhancing prediction accuracy and enabling real-time corrections during lunar mission. 

Through the Lunar Starship project, researchers are paving the way for sustainable lunar exploration, as it not only optimizes missions but also conserves valuable resources for extended stays on the Moon. By allowing for the integration of real dynamic functions, it fosters adaptability and resilience in lunar operations, making it a cornerstone of future lunar exploration endeavors.

All project installation, code overview and usage details also available in the project [GitHub page](https://github.com/citros-garden/lunar_starship).


## CITROS Usage üõ∏
Although you can get simulation results using FoxGlove, the best way to work with such simulations and process the results is CITROS! With its power, it is possible to create complex data processing scenarios, including the construction of more complex graphs, mathematical analysis and other high-level processing methods.

### CITROS Installation üõ´

First of all, to use all the powerfull CITROS features usage requires CITROS installation: follow the instructions on the CITROS CLI [GitHub page](https://github.com/lulav/citros_cli).

### Configuring the Project ‚öôÔ∏è
After all the prerequisites done, we can start configuring our project. The starting point is the Lunar_Starship devcontainer loaded and running, CITROS CLI is installed and ready.
1. Initialize CITROS:
```bash 
citros init
```
Now you can see ```.citros``` folder in the explorer.

2. Configuring the setup. We need to set up the maximum perfomance available: timeout, CPU, GPU and Memory. To perform it, we need to define it in the ```.citros/simulations/simulation_lunar_starship.json```. The recommended setup is minimum 600 seconds timeout, 4 CPU, 4 GPU and 4096 MB of Memory. Don't forget to save the file!

3. Configuring the params setup. You can find default setup in ```.citros/parameter_setups/default_param_setup.json```. Variables with '_0' are initial conditions, and variables with '_f' are final conditions respectively. Don't forget to save the file!

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
\text{Parameter} & \text{Description} \\
\hline
h_0 & \text{initial altitude above lunar surface level} \\
lat_0 & \text{initial latitude} \\
long_0 & \text{initial longitude} \\
vn_0 & \text{initial "northing" velocity} \\
ve_0 & \text{initial "east" velocity} \\
vd_0 & \text{initial vertical velocity} \\
m\_fuel_0 & \text{initial fuel mass} \\
lat_f & \text{final latitude} \\
long_f & \text{final longitude} \\
vn_f & \text{final "northing" velocity} \\
ve_f & \text{final "east" velocity} \\
vd_f & \text{final vertical velocity} \\
m_{\text{fuel f}}& \text{final fuel mass} \\
dry~mass_f & \text{dry mass} \\
F_{\text{thrustmax}} & \text{The maximum amount of thrust} \\
I_{\text{sp}} & \text{Specific impulse} \\
simulation~step & \text{step of simulation} \\
publish~freq & \text{frequency of publishing} \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

4. Launch files. This project contains only one launch file ```lunar_starship.launch.py```. This file will be used for CITROS launch. 

### Syncing the Project's Setup üì°
Now we can sync our project settings with CITROS server:
```bash 
citros commit
citros push
```
:::tip

CITROS CLI in addition to other advantages also provides automatic ROS bag recording option, which allows user to use saved simulation results and export them! :)

### Running Locally üõãÔ∏è
Since all the preparations done, we can launch it locally (your project should be built and sourced before that):
```bash 
citros run -n 'Lunar_Starship' -m 'local test run'
```
Select the launch file (should be the only one here) by pressing ```Enter``` button and wait for the output in the terminal. To plot the local run results you can use FoxGlove.

### Uploading Docker Image to the CITROS database and running in the cloud üõ∞Ô∏è
1. We need to build and push Docker container image to the CITROS server:
```bash 
citros docker-build-push
```

2. Finally, we can run it in the cloud! Simply add ```-r``` to the terminal command: 
```bash 
citros run -n 'Lunar_Starship' -m 'cloud test run' -r
```
Select the launch file (should be the only one here) by pressing ```Enter``` button. Now the simulation is running in the CITROS server, and it will upload results to the CITROS database automaticly.

### CITROS Web Usage and Data Analysis üåå
#### Launching Project via CITROS Web
The best way to use all the innovative capabilities of CITROS is through it's Web interface. The following manual explains how to run this project in the cloud and how to process the simualtion results.
The starting point is CITROS main page, user is logged in and the project Docker image is built and pushed to the cloud (see the [manual](#uploading-docker-image-to-the-citros-database-and-running-in-the-cloud-üõ∞Ô∏è) above).
1. Go to the ```Repositories``` page clicking on the tab on the top;
2. Find your project and open it;
3. Navigate to the ```Runs``` tab;
4. Click on the ```Run Simulation``` button on the right;
5. Now you can choose the project and the simulation setup from the droplists, set the number of repeats and how many simulations should run in parallel, type the Name of the run and the additional message. This window also shows the perfomance preset.
6. We are ready to go! Start the Batch with the button below.

The simualtion launched! Open the Run you just started in the list on ```Runs``` page to check how is it going. In this page you can find all the runs of this batch. The number of runs here equals to the number of runs you've set before.
Navigate to the Run by clicking on it in the table:
* The main part of this page is a simulation's log. Here you can find all the logging information from all levels: from your code logs up to the CITROS system information.
* The right part of the page provides additional information about Events: the main stages of the simulation run.

#### Working with Integrated Jupiter Notebooks
CITROS Web provides powerfull data analisys package, which is comprehensive solution for data query, analysis and visualization. With its extensive features, you can quickly and easily extract valuable insights from your data. To use it, the Jupiter Notebook support is built-in. 
Navigate to our project ```Code``` page, open the Notebooks folder and click on the notebook file. Here you can see the usual Jupiter editor's interface: you can add blocks of code or built-in Markdown engine, run and save notebook and control the Python kernel.

You can find all the data analisys package guides and API reference [here](https://citros.io/doc/docs_data_analysis).
