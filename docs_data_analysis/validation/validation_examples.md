# Validation Examples

This section contains examples of workflows for setting up validation tests. Taking into consideration various simulations, you can establish correspondence between their results, compute statistics, and verify if, for example, the mean values or standard deviations fall within the specified limits. All these tasks can be efficiently accomplished in munimul steps using the **validation** module.
