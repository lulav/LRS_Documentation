The `project.json` file contains metadata about your ROS 2 project and it is automatically generated by the CITROS `init`, `run` and `status` commands.

## More Information
Here's a description of its top-level fields:

- `citros_cli_version`: the CITROS CLI version installed.
- `cover`: A placeholder for a potential image that represents the project.
- `description`: A string for providing a detailed description of the project.
- `git`: The git repository URL associated with the project.
- `image`: A name that corresponds to the docker image of the project.
- `is_active`: A boolean flag indicating whether the project is active or not.  
- `launches`: An array for storing metadata about launch files associated with the project. 
**Note**: these are the global launch files, which are not associated with any specific package. Generally, they are less commonly used. For package launch files, see inside the list of *packages*.
- `license`: A string indicating the license of the project.
- `name`: The name of the project. *Note*: this is the only field that you may edit and it will not be overwritten during subsequent citros commands.
- `packages`: An array of objects that describe the ROS packages that exist within the project.
- `path`: The directory path to the project.
- `readme`: The contents of the project's README file.
- `tags`: An array of strings for tagging and categorizing the project.

In the `packages` array, each object describes a specific package within the project. These objects contain similar information to the top-level fields, with additional fields:

- `maintainer`: The maintainer of the package.
- `maintainer_email`: The email address of the maintainer.
- `nodes`: An array of objects describing each node in the package, including their parameters and entry points.
- `package_xml`: The path to the package's XML file.
- `setup_py`: The path to the package's `setup.py` file. For python ROS 2 projects only.
- `cmake`: The path to the package's `CMakeLists.txt` file. For C++ ROS 2 projects only.
- `parameters`: An array of objects that describe the package-level parameters, i.e. parameters which are not associated with any node. As with node-level parameters, this includes their name, type, and value.

The `nodes` array contains objects that describe the ROS 2 nodes within a package. Each object includes the following fields:

- `entry_point`: The entry point for the node, typically the function that should be executed when the node is run.
- `name`: The name of the node.
- `parameters`: An array of objects that describe the parameters associated with the node, including their name, type, and value.
- `path`: The path to the node's Python file.
