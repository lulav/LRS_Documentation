# Settings Json

The `settings.json` file holds configuration settings for your CITROS repository.

## MOre Information
Here is a breakdown of each field in this file:

- `name`: The name of the current settings profile. This can be useful if you want to maintain different sets of settings for different contexts (e.g., 'default_settings', 'debug_settings', etc.).
- `force_message`: This is a boolean setting (in string format). If set to "True", it enforces that a descriptive message is provided for each batch of simulation runs. This can be helpful for keeping track of the purpose or characteristics of each run batch.
- `force_batch_name`: Similar to force_message, this is a boolean setting (in string format). If set to "True", it enforces that a unique name is provided for each batch of simulation runs. This can be useful for organizing and identifying different batches of runs.
