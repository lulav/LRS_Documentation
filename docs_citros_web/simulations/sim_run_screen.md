# Run Page Overview

**Introduction:**
The Simulation Log Page provides a detailed record of all simulation logs across various levels, from high-level batch (e.g., CITROS level) down to granular simulation logging levels. It also showcases the status messages related to the simulation, offering insights into the simulation's progression, state, and any potential issues or milestones.

Step-by-Step Tutorial:

1. **Understanding Simulation Info**
   - View the Simulation Info to comprehend the specifics and context of the simulation whose logs are being viewed.

2. **Viewing and Analyzing the Simulation Log**
   - Review the detailed Simulation Log in the center of the page for a comprehensive view of all messages and data logged during the simulation.
   - Analyze the logs to understand the simulation’s progression, identify potential issues, or extract data for further analysis and reporting.
   - Search/Filter logs if possible, to pinpoint specific events, messages, or timeframes of interest.

3. **Monitoring and Utilizing Status Info**
   - Monitor the Status Info section on the right to keep track of the simulation’s ongoing status and progression.
   - Review the most recent status message at the top, and peruse previous messages to understand the historical progression of the simulation status.
   - Use the status messages for quick insights into the simulation's health, state, and any noteworthy events or issues.

3. **Managing and Troubleshooting Simulations**
   - Leverage the detailed simulation log for deep dives into the simulation's behavior, identifying issues, or validating expected actions and outcomes.
   - Utilize the status messages to quickly identify and respond to any issues, changes, or milestones during the simulation.
   - Document or export logs and status messages for record-keeping, reporting, or sharing with other stakeholders.
