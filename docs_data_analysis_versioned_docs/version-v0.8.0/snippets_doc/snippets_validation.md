# Validation

## Overview

Let's consider a table for topic 'my_topic' from the batch 'my_batch', where each row under the 'data' column contains dictionaries with keys 'x', 'y', and 'z', as illustrated:



|data                |
|--------------------|
|{x: 1, y: 2, z: 3}  |
|{x: 4, y: 5, z: 6}  |
|...                 |


Let's assume that there are number of simulations (sids) and we would like to perform several test on this data to evaluate the quality of the simulation results.

The pipeline is the following: query data, define the independent variable (that is used to establish the correspondence between different simulations), set test parameters.


## Checking the Standard Deviation Boundary

Whether the standard deviation boundary is within the limits.

```python
# --- adjust to your data --- #

# Set batch and topic names.
batch_name = 'my_batch'
topic_name = 'my_topic'

# Data labels
data_labels = ['data.x', 'data.y', 'data.z']

# Set time step to construct independent variable column as: Time = rid*time_step.
time_step  = 0.2

# 'method' defines how the index assignment will be done:
#    - 'scale': by scaling independent variable to unit interval and interpolating data on this interval,
#    - 'bin': by dividing independent variable on bins and calculating mean data values among points fallen in each bin
method = 'bin'

# limits: a one value to set the same +-limits to each element of the vector, for examples limits = 0.25
#        list of values to set +-limits for each vector element, for examples limits = [0.25, 0.5, 100]
#        list of lists to set lower and upper intervals separately, for examples limits = [0.25, [-0.3, 0.8], [-150, 100]]
limits = [0.25, [-0.3, 0.8], [-150, 100]]

# number of standard deviations in standard deviation boundary
n_std = 3

# whether nan values are treated as passed test or not
nan_passed = True

# to style the output plot:
# std_area - set True to fill with color standard deviation boundary
std_area = False
# std_lines - set False to remove standard deviation boundary lines
std_lines = True
# std_color - set standard deviation boundary color, default 'b'
std_color = 'b'
# --------------------------- #

from citros_data_analysis import validation as va

citros = da.CitrosDB()

# query data.
df = citros.batch(batch_name).topic(topic_name).data(data_labels)
# construct independent variable column as: Time = rid*time_step
df['Time'] = df['rid']*time_step

# construct Validation object. It determines how the data will be preprocessed: 
#'data_label' determine data columns, 
#'param_label' is for independent variable that will be used for defining indexes and setting correspondence between different sids 
#'method' defines how the index assignment will be done:
#    - 'scale': by scaling independent variable to unit interval and interpolating data on this interval,
#    - 'bin': by dividing independent variable on bins and calculating mean data values among points fallen in each bin
#'num' determines number of points if method set as 'scale' or bins if 'method' set as 'bin':
V = va.Validation(df, data_label = data_labels, param_label = 'Time', 
                  method = method, num = 50, units = 'm')

# Set test
log, table, fig = V.std_bound_test(limits = limits, n_std = n_std, nan_passed = nan_passed, 
            std_area = std_area, std_lines = std_lines, std_color = std_color)

# print the report of the test:
log.print()

#DataFrame table that for each point indicates whether it passes the test or not:
print(table.head(5)) #method head(n) shows first n rows of the DataFrame table
```
## Checking the Mean Value
Test whether the mean values are within the defined boundaries.
Even when some points of the individual simulations may exceed the limits, but the test will be passed for those, whose mean values are within limits.

```python
# --- adjust to your data --- #

# Set batch and topic names.
batch_name = 'my_batch'
topic_name = 'my_topic'

# Data labels
data_labels = ['data.x', 'data.y', 'data.z']

time_step  = 0.2

# 'method' defines how the index assignment will be done:
#    - 'scale': by scaling independent variable to unit interval and interpolating data on this interval,
#    - 'bin': by dividing independent variable on bins and calculating mean data values among points fallen in each bin
method = 'bin'
