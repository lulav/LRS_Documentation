## Install CITROS

Before you start using CITROS locally, you have to make it available on your computer. 
Even if it’s already installed, it’s probably a good idea to update to the latest version. 
You can either install it as a package or via another installer, or download the source code and compile it yourself.

#### Install on Linux
#### Install on MacOS
#### Install on Windows
#### Installing from Package
#### Installing from Source
