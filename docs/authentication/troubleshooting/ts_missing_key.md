# Deleted or Missing SSH Keys

As a security precaution, CITROS automatically deletes SSH keys that haven't been used in a year.

CITROS automatically deletes inactive SSH keys to help keep accounts safe, such as after someone leaves a job or loses a computer.

You can check if you haven't used an SSH key in a year by reviewing your account's security log. For more information, see "Reviewing your security log."

After your inactive SSH key is deleted, you must generate a new SSH key and associate it with your account. For more information, see ["Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent"](/docs/authentication/ssh/ssh_generate_key.md) and ["Adding a new SSH key to your CITROS account"](/docs/authentication/ssh/ssh_add_new.md).
