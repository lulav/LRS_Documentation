# Repositories Overview
 
Managing and storing team projects becomes easier when you have repositories. They act as a centralized location that helps you track and organize changes to files and code, facilitating collaboration and maintaining a history of revisions.

In CITROS, you can use the [`pull`](/docs_cli/commands/cli_commands#command-pull) and [`push`](/docs_cli/commands/cli_commands#command-push) CLI commands to sync your local project modifications with the remote repository. This not only backs up your work on the server but also enables seamless collaboration with other team members using the CITROS platform.
