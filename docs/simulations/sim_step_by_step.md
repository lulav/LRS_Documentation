2. Ensure the appropriate Repository and Branch are selected, choose the simulation setup, and specify the number of runs and parallel launches:

   2.1 Choose repository to run your simulation

   2.2 Choose branch

   2.3 Choose simulation

   2.4 Define in repetitions filed how many times you'd like to repeat your simulation

   2.5 Define in parallelism filed, how many simulations will run in parallel in each iteration (parallelism <= repetitions).
