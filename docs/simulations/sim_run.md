# Batch Page Overview

## Overview
The Batch page provides a comprehensive dashboard that allows users to monitor and manage batch simulation runs, offering detailed information about each run and overall batch status, while also providing insights into the development context in which the simulations were run.

The top of this page contains the Batch Run Info for quick review of the context and purpose of the current batch simulation.

The Simulation Runs Table is located in the center of the page. You can observe it to monitor the status and progress of individual simulations in the batch. Click on specific simulation IDs or rows to navigate to detailed run page.

Review the Additional Info section (on the right) to gain insights into the batch's status, progress, and associated development context (git branch, commit ID).
Use this information for troubleshooting, understanding the developer context, and monitoring database status.

Utilize the information from the table and additional info to manage ongoing simulations and plan subsequent runs or analyses. Act upon any error or warning messages to troubleshoot or optimize subsequent simulation runs.
